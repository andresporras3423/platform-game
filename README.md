# What it does

- Platform game built with Phaser3

# GAME DESIGN

## Objectives for this project

- Built a platform game inspired in the running dinosaur game
- The elements of the game should make anyone recall the original game (main character, background, obstacles)
- The game include platform game features (objects to collect, double jump)
- As an additional feature I wanted to add the option of change difficulty so the player can get use to the game using the easy mode.

## How to play

- Before starting a game, the player can type one's name, otherwise score will be save using default "Anon" name.

- The basic goal of the game is to get a high score, to do that player must try to collect meats and stay alive.
- By default player can make double jump but the game include an easy mode which allow player to do triple jump.
- to survive player must not fall and jump over the cactus.
- Player get points when one catch meats (20 points) or when jump over cactus (50 points)
- Player has three lifes, one lose a life if doesn't jump over an obstacle or fall down from the platform

## Features
- Main menu has three options, play to start a new game, credits to my contact information, and level to change the difficulty.
